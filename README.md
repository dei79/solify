# solify - Simplify typical chef-solo deployments

solify is a set of cookbooks and tools which makes it ultra simple to move a basic system into a server which is able to run ruby on rails applications. Everything will be prepared in a way that the application can be deployed via capistrano into this server. 

## Just do it
> Log into you server via ssh with a user who has sudo rights!
> Execute the right bootstrapper for your base platform
